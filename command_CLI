A = [1 2; 3 4; 5 6]
the matrix A will be like that
A = 
1 2
3 4
5 6

% the CLI system control
pwd % display your current path

cd 'your_path' % access to your_path

load(your_file) % load your file into Octave

who % display various of variable
whos % display the details of variable such as name, matrix size, byte , class

clear % delete all variables
clear the_variable_name % delete the specific variable

% The matrix accessment
size(A) % this command will display the numbers of row and col into the row vector
        % the result should be like that 3 2
        
size(A,1) % the number of the row of the matrix A
size(A,2) % the number of the col of the matrix A

length(A) % the longest dimension of the matrix A
          % the result should be 3

%suppose you have the variable B which is declared
B = A(1:6) % it means take the element start form 1 to 6( A(start,end) )
           % the order is from col1 to coln
the result will be
B = 
1 3 5 2 4 6

A(1,:) % the ':' means the every element. In this case mean that all elements in all col which the row is 1
the result
1 2

% concate with 2 matrixs
There are the matrix C and A
C =              A =
11 12            1 2
13 14            3 4
15 16            5 6

D = [C A] % A will concate in right hand side
D = 
11 12 1 2
13 14 3 4
15 16 5 6

E = [C;A] % A will concate in the below of C
E =
11 12
13 14
15 16
1  2
3  4
5  6

E(:) & let all elements display in sigle vector
     & the order from col1 to col2
result like 
11
13
15
1
3
5
12
14
16
2
4
6
